## 🧠 About Me

I am a Master's student in Geophysics at Lomonosov Moscow State University (graduating in 2026) and have completed professional retraining in **Data Science at Yandex Practicum**.  
I combine a strong foundation in physics and mathematics with hands-on machine learning skills.

**Why Data Science?**  
I've always been passionate about uncovering hidden patterns in data and turning them into actionable solutions. In geophysics, I worked with massive volumes of seismic and well-log data — writing Python scripts for automation, building modeling applications, and implementing methodologies that accelerated processing by orders of magnitude. Alongside this, I've worked on pet projects in telecom, retail, HR, and oil & gas — from churn prediction to computer vision.

**My motivation** is to solve real business problems and grow continuously as a specialist.  
I aim to bring value to products and companies through rigorous data analysis and well-grounded recommendations.
